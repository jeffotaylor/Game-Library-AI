1. Create a `Game` component that will house the game logic.
2. Implement the basic game mechanics for Flappy Bird.
    - Create a "bird" that is affected by gravity.
    - Allow the player to make the bird "jump" by clicking.
    - Create pipes that move from right to left.
    - Detect collisions between the bird and the pipes.
    - Implement a scoring system.
3. Create a main `App` component to display the game and the game selection menu.
4. Style the website with a modern, sleek, dark theme.
5. Create a menu to select different games (for now, only Flappy Bird is available).
